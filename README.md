# HJBsByFVM
This repository contains Matlab code for the solution of HJB equations and PDEs in non-divergence form by finite volume methods. 
It supports many example problems defined in:
    
    setupNonvariationalPDE
    setupEllipticHJB
    setupEllipticVI
    setupParabolicNVPDE
    setupParabolicHJB
    setupParabolicVI

The script `solveProblem` contains already many commented example problems and should serve as a good starting point for further experiments.
The scripts starting with `diss_*` contain the most recent experiments that where used to prepare the figures in my Dissertation.
